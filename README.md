## About Me  
I am a robotics and drone engineer passionate about autonomous systems, computer vision, and embedded development.  
Currently, I work at ARK Electronics in Salt Lake City, where I develop ROS2 tutorials, PX4 flight modes, and embedded drivers for UAV systems.  

My background combines robotics research, engineering, and teaching—ranging from drone swarms and CNC cyber-physical systems to guiding students in ROS2 programming.  

Outside of engineering, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and photography.
