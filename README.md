## About Me  
I am a Robotics and UAV engineer from Hungary, who is passionate about autonomous systems, computer vision, stochastic control and embedded development, lately I am getting involved with physical AI.  
Currently, during my Fulbright scholarship I work at ARK Electronics in Salt Lake City, where I develop ROS2 tutorials, PX4 flight modes, and embedded drivers for UAV systems, moreover I focus on hardware and software integration with the Jetson and Pi platform.  

My background combines robotics research, engineering, and teaching—ranging from drone swarms and CNC cyber-physical systems to guiding students in ROS2 programming.  

Outside of engineering, I enjoy traveling, hiking, snowboarding, climbing and photography.
